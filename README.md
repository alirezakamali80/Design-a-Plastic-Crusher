# Design of a Plastic Crusher Machine

This repository contains the design documentation for a group project completed in the Machine Elements Design (2) course at the University of Tehran, under Dr. Abrinia, during the 2023-2024 academic year. The project focused on designing an efficient plastic crusher for recycling purposes, addressing operational constraints, force and stress calculations, material selection, and component optimization.
**Team Members**: S. Pourkhavari, P. Sobhani, A. H. Ghazanfarian, A. Kamali, E. Gohari, A. Moharrami.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Designed a plastic crusher machine to process waste plastics into smaller pieces for recycling, emphasizing sustainability, efficiency, and structural integrity under given constraints.

- **Approach**: Followed a systematic mechanical design process including literature review, conceptual design (QFD, function structures), embodiment design (components, assembly, manufacturing), detailed analysis (forces, stresses, FEA), and optimization.
- **Key Features**:
  - Hopper for feeding plastics.
  - Dual crushing shafts with ring or knife-edge blades.
  - Speed reduction via belt-pulley system.
  - Robust frame to support loads.
- **Analysis**: Performed load analysis, stress calculations, and finite element analysis (FEA) to ensure components like shafts, gears, and frames withstand operational forces without failure or excessive deformation.
- **Results**: The design met capacity requirements (e.g., 60 kW power transfer at 500 RPM), with maximum stresses below material yield strengths. Verified through simulations showing no pitting or bending failures.

- **Challenges**: Handling nonlinear dependencies in component sizing, material selection for durability, and optimizing for maintainability.
- **Tools**: SOLIDWORKS for CAD modeling, motion studies, and FEA simulations; manual calculations for belts, gears, shafts, and bearings.

This project demonstrates skills in mechanical engineering design, including component integration, stress analysis, and sustainable engineering practices. It highlights team collaboration and practical application of course concepts.
